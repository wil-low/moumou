# 🂡 **Moumou — Complete Rules & Strategy Guide**

---

## **1. Deck & Initial Deal**

* **Deck:** 36 cards, ranks `6 7 8 9 T J Q K A` in suits `s h d c`.
* **Card notation:** `Rs` (rank + suit), e.g., `Th`, `Js`.
* **Initial deal:**

  * Each player receives **5 cards**.
  * The dealer places **their last dealt card** on the table as the **first card played**.
  * Dealer may then continue with **covering or combo plays** if applicable.
* **Table visibility:** All cards played are tracked; only the **last 4 cards** are “visible” for strategy purposes.

---

## **2. Turn Mechanics**

* On a player’s turn, they may play:

  * A card matching the **last card’s rank** or **suit**, or
  * A **Jack** (always playable).
* **Combos:** Multiple cards of the same rank may be played in a single turn.
* **6:** Can be played after any card. After playing a 6, you must **cover** it by playing:

  * Another 6,
  * A card of the same suit, or
  * Any Jack.
  * If none, draw cards **one by one until a valid cover is found**.
* If a player cannot play:

  * Draw **one card at a time** until playable.
  * If still no playable card → skip turn.

## **3. Special Card Effects**

| Card                | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7                   | Opponent draws **1 card per 7 played** and continues turn.                                                                                                                                     |
| 8                   | Opponent draws **2 cards per 8 played** and **skips turn**.                                                                                                                                    |
| Ace                 | Opponent **skips turn** (not cumulative). Cannot be the last card to win.                                                                                                                      |
| King of Clubs (Kc) | Opponent draws **5 cards** and **skips turn**.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Jack                | Always playable. When played, **demand a suit**. Opponent must play: card of that suit, or another Jack. If not possible → draw 1 card → if still no → skip. Multiple Jacks = one suit demand. |
| Last-card Jack      | If Jack(s) are played as last card(s) to empty hand: **no suit demand**; instead choose either: subtract 20 pts from your score or add 20 pts to opponent’s score.                             |

## **4. Moumou Event**

* If **last 4 visible cards** are all of the **same rank**, a **Moumou event** occurs.
* Game ends immediately, proceed with scoring.

---

## **5. Deck Depletion**

* If deck is empty, take **all table cards except the last 4**, shuffle, and form a new deck.

---

## **6. Scoring**

* At game end (either by empty hand or Moumou):

  * **Jacks:** 20 pts
  * **Aces:** 15 pts
  * **Kings/Queens:** 10 pts
  * **Number cards:** face value (6–10)
* **Cumulative match:**

  * Players start at 0 pts.
  * After each game, points are added.
  * If a player **exceeds agreed point limit**, they **lose the match**.

---

## **7. Endgame Restrictions**

* A player **cannot win** by playing:

  * A **6** (must cover first)
  * An **Ace** (opponent draws 1; if unplayable → skip turn)

---

## **8. Strategy Tips**

1. **Hand Management**

   * Avoid leaving Jacks, Aces, or 6s as last cards unless you can cover or use points advantage.
   * Dump high-value cards early if safe.
   * Keep flexible cards for combos or covering.

2. **Offense**

   * Play 7’s, 8’s, and Kc to **force opponent draws or skip turns**.
   * Use Jacks to demand suits and control flow.

3. **Endgame**

   * Plan moves to empty your hand **without leaving a 6 or Ace** as last card.
   * Last-card Jacks: strategically add points to opponent or subtract from self.
   * Monitor for **Moumou risk** in last 4 table cards.

4. **Suit & Combo Control**

   * Chain combos to shed multiple cards quickly.
   * Keep diverse suits to maximize playable options.

5. **Match Context**

   * Ahead in points: play defensively, minimize high-card penalties.
   * Behind: use Jacks, force Moumou events, offload high-value cards.
   * Balance short-term moves with long-term scoring.
